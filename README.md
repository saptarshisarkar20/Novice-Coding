## Novice Coding
It's an initiative to help create more awareness about Open Source and help introduce many more students to the benefits of FOSS. We will organize lots of events that will prove to be very profitable for the students and encourage them to contribute in open source, this is our humble step.

Lots of students struggle in creating their first PR. They try somewhat and leave when couldn't. We created this as learning repo on how to create successful pull requests on languages like JAVA, Python, C++, HTML/CSS.
